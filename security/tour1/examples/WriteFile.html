Here's an applet that tries to write to the file named "writetest".

<p>
<applet code=WriteFile.class width=500 height=150 alt="WritingFile applet">
</applet></p>
<p>
If you don't see the applet, download and install
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">
the JDK or JRE.</a>
</p>
<p>
Here's the <a href=WriteFile.java>source</a>.

This applet won't work unless you've configured your policy
to allow it to write such a file; if not, you
will see an AccessControlException.

If you've configured your system to 
allow applets from this applets' location to write the specified file, 
check your current directory!
You'll find a file there named "writetest".
