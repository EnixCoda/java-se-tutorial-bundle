# Java SE Tutorial Bundle

This is the tutorial bundle from [Oracle Java SE tutorial homepage](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/), last updated at 2021-2-10. The only modification is that I added this readme file. Publishing this repo as the download process from the official site is too tedious if you do not own an Oracle account and I find no relative repos on GitHub about this.
