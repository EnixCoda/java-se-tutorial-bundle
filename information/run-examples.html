<a class="TutorialLink" target="_top" href="../getStarted/index.html">Getting Started</a> trail. This lesson includes links to download the latest JDK for Windows, Linux, and Solaris. There are also instructions and links for the NetBeans&trade; IDE, which runs on all the above platforms.</p>

<p><a class="q" name="q2" id="q2">I already have the JRE. Why do I need the JDK?</a> The Java SE Runtime Environment, or JRE, allows you to run programs that have already been compiled and deployed. We hope you will use the Tutorials to expand your understanding of Java technology by modifying and extending the examples. To do this, you need the JDK.</p>
