<p>These errors are corrected in the 4th printing.</p>
<ul>
<li>CD problems on Linux:
<p>Some Linux systems automount the CD with a filesystem that forces all file names to lower case. This will break browser links to HTML files with mixed-case names, and also prevent the examples from compiling.</p>
<p>If you have this problem, try manually mounting the CD with the UDF filesystem. To do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Become superuser.</li>
<li>Unmount the cd:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
umount <i>cd_device_path</i>
</pre></div>
</li>
<li>Remount the the cd using the UDF filesystem:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
mount -t udf <i>cd_device_path cd_mount_point</i>
</pre></div>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Chapter 1: Getting Started, page 3:
<p>The source code inside figure 1.2 is missing a closing bracket to end the class definition.</p>
<p>The missing bracket appears in bold below:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
<strong>}</strong>

<li>Chapter 3: Language Basics, page 59:
<p>Typo fix: In the following sentence, the word &quot;operand&quot; (shown in bold) was mistakenly printed as &quot;operator&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;The equality and relational operators determine if one <strong>operand</strong> is greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to another operand.&quot;</p>

<p>In the example in the second paragraph, getX and getY should be changed to getX() and getY() so that the 3rdand 4th lines in the example read:</p>

circle.setX(circle.getX() + deltaX);
circle.setY(circle.getY() + deltaY);

<p>The last word in the Note should be changed from &quot;variables&quot; to &quot;methods&quot; so that the sentence reads: &quot;You can also refer to static methods with an object reference like instanceName.methodName(args) but this is discouraged because it does not make it clear that they are class methods.&quot;</p>

<p>The code &quot;if ( (obj1)isLargerThan(obj2)) ...&quot; should be changed to &quot;if ( (obj1)isLargerThan(obj2) ...&quot; in three places by removing the extra parenthesis, ). The three lines should read:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
if ( (obj1)isLargerThan(obj2) &gt; 0);
if ( (obj1)isLargerThan(obj2) &lt; 0);
if ( (obj1)isLargerThan(obj2) == 0);

<p>The second paragraph from the bottom reads: To see this effect more clearly, try removing the <code>continue</code> statement and recompiling. When you run the program again, the count will be wrong, saying that it found <b>44</b> p&#39;s instead of 9. In fact, when you run the program again, the count is <b>35</b>.</p>

<li>Appendix A
<p>There is a clarification to the descriptive text above the keyword list.</p>
<p>Previous text: &quot;Here&#39;s a list of keywords in the Java language. These words are reserved &mdash; you cannot use any of these words as names in your programs. <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>null</code> are not keywords but they are reserved words, so you cannot use them as names in your programs either.&quot;</p>
<p>Clarified text: &quot;Here&#39;s a list of keywords in the Java programming language. You cannot use any of the following as identifiers in your programs. The keywords <code>const</code> and <code>goto</code> are reserved, even though they are not currently used. <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and <code>null</code> might seem like keywords, but they are actually literals; you cannot use them as identifiers in your programs.&quot;</p>
